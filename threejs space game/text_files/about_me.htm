    <p>Hello, and welcome to my webpage. My name is Dustin Guest, an aspireing software developer.</p>
 
    <p>
        I am a recent graduate from the University of Regina with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and Computer Science. 
        I have strong programming skills and graduated with distinction. I am looking to be a valued member of a 
        software development team.
    </p>
    
    <P>
        I am passionate about computer technology, taking any opportunity to learn more about programming languages, 
        new algorithms, and how to create better, more reliable and intuitive software. I am incredibly passionate 
        about developing 3D applications for the web, with WebGL applications, but I am also interested in developing 
        my knowledge of other 3D APIs such as Vulkan and Direct3D. I am also interested in web and mobile development,
         as well as developing small interactive IoT devices.
    </P>
    
    <p>
        I am skilled in developing interactive 2D and 3D graphics for web pages. I am also interested in developing
        and implementing AI for solving problems, developing interactive gadgets, and programming software that provides
        an intuitive user experience. I have experience developing webpages that interact with server-side databases
        such as MySQL on an Apache server using PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I look forward to working with a team of like-minded developers and striving to develop my knowledge of programing
        language and technologies further to be an even more valuable member of the team.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I have worked in manual labour for a small landscape construction company. 
        During this time, I have become a leader of a small team of construction workers and have learned to work as a team member and manager. 
        I have also spent a lot of time working directly with customers to ensure they are satisfied with the work. 
        While this is a very different field, my experience working with and managing a small team would help me as part of a software development team.

    <h3 id="education">Education</h3>

    <p>
        I am an alumnus of the University of Regina, having two Bachelor's degrees. 
        My first bachelor's degree is a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy, obtained in 2020. 
        My second degree is a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, acquired in 2022. 
        Of note is that I graduated with distinction in 2022. 
    </p>

    <p>
        During my education, I have learned Object-oriented programing methodologies and 
        the importance of software engineering to any software project. 
        I have developed stronger mathematical problem-solving skills and acquired experience 
        using technologies such as databases, compilers, and debuggers.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am constantly looking to expand my education. In the future, 
        I plan to improve my knowledge of computer technologies further. 
    </p>

    <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>

    <p> When I'm not coding and learning about new technologies, I am oftain working with my hands. 
        I have taken up amateur woodworking. Most recently, I have built a small tool shed; this is the largest 
        woodworking project I have undertaken. Most of my other woodworking projects are smaller, such 
        as tables or shelving units. </p>

    <p> I am also an avid movie watcher. I love the experience of going to the theatre, 
        though I have not been able to go as often in the past few years. </p>
        
    <p>
        When I am stressed, I like to go for walks or runs in the park, 
        though I have been exercising less than I should in the last few years, 
        and I am trying to get back into shape.</p>

    <p>
        I am also an avid gamer. I enjoy both video games and board games (though in recent years,
        I have not been able to play as many board games as I would have liked.) I enjoy playing RPG and Puzzle games,
        though I often play FPS and Action games.
