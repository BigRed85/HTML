    <h3 id="info">Information</h3>

    <p>
        This web application is a work in progress that will act as an interactive resume for me(Dustin Guest). 
        It contains information about me and the skills I have acquired as a software developer.
    </p>

    <p>
        This web application is developed primarily in javascript and uses the <a href="threejs.org">three.js</a> library.
    </p>

    <h3 id="future">Future Plans</h3>

    <p>
        This is where I will describe my future plans for this web application.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Improve the structure of the code! It is a bit too procedural and can be improved by a better, more object-oriented design.</li>
        <li>Improve the look of the subsections, including better, more dynamic transitions when opening the subsections.</li>
        <li>Add support for mobile devices, including touch controls.</li>
        <li>Add collision physics to the rocket ship allowing it to interact with objects, and add things for it to interact with (perhaps some asteroids).</li>
        <li>Add a more dynamic background with twinkling stars.</li>
        
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
